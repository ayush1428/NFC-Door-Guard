# NFC-Door-Guard
# In the age of automation where almost all household appliances are having the term “smart”, the need for a secured door system together with an automated circuit breaker is indeed a must have for being in the trend. 
# With the use of NFC technology, entering a door hassle-free without countless keys and opening any door with just a tap of a single tag, which can be used as a keychain, is possible. 
# The NFC Door Guard which comes with an PN532 Reader Writer and Raspberry pi for controlling the operations for door opening and closing and with the help of the servo motor. # We will read the encrypted password through the NFC tag and the door will open if the password matches. 
# For extra security we are storing passwords in the encrypted format. 
# For Encryption we are using a symmetric type of encryption. 
# The system prototype is evaluated, and it is 100% accurate when recognizing and authorizing an NFC card. 
# It can also be reset in case of any theft of a card. 
# For this purpose, we have developed an app which can monitor the log and add new users and users will also be able to see the logs of the person who has unlocked the door, all accessible through an Android application.
